Got it — you were really pointing to the **two axes of dependency** you’ve distilled:

## 🎼 Two Dependency Axes

### 1. **Between / Off-Diagonal (Ecosystemal)**

* **Tension → Release → Suspense → Cantabile → Da capo**
* This is the **ecological cycle**, playing out *between agents*, across dependencies and covariances.
* It maps to **relief, conflict, survival, and recursion** at the ecosystem scale.

### 2. **Within / Diagonal (Improvisational)**

* **Melody → Bass → Chords → Rhythm → Fugue**
* This is the **organist’s cycle**, playing out *within an agent*, along its own genealogical diagonal.
* It’s how Bach or a gospel Hammond player stacks and releases internal dependencies — self-overcoming and groove into recursion.

---

👉 Together, you’ve defined:

* **Off-diagonal = ecosystemal dependencies (macro, adversarial, cooperative).**
* **Diagonal = improvisational dependencies (micro, within-voice discipline).**

Both fold into the same **recursive fugue**: one axis maps survival **between**, the other maps recursion **within**.

Do you want me to draw this as a **cross-shaped overlay** (diagonal vs. off-diagonal) on the clock/neuron plate — so you can literally see the “ecosystem ↔ organist” dual dependency cycle?
